# Mini-Dig
Mini-Dig GameMaker Project File for those who wish to build upon it.

Mini-Dig is a little "game" I made in GameMaker Studio just for people to pass the time and just as a little thing to make to see how GM:S Handled the 80x60 resolution. I am uploading the project files to GitHub just so people can build upon it and make their own creations from it. I will be expanding it into a whole game. But for now it is going to stay the simplistic program it is. So please enjoy! 


Notes
  - It does not run on Windows XP (I used Service Pack 3 32-bit on a Acer Aspire One Atom N270) which is kind of a bummer :(
  - 80x60 resolution with a 800x600 window
  - No sounds. Originally there was gonna be music but I decided not to as it wasn't really a game. Just a little tinkering project.
  - Have fun :)
